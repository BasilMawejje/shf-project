  Scenario Outline: Renews on days around expiration (all requirements met)
    Given the date is set to "<the_date>"
    And I am logged in as "member-all-reqs-met@example.com"
    And I am on the "user account" page
    Then I should see <renewal_title>
    And I should see <renewal_instructions>
    And the link button t("users.show.pay_membership") should not be disabled
    When I click on t("users.show.pay_membership")
    And I complete the membership payment
    And the user is paid through "<new_paid_thru_date>"

    Scenarios:
      | the_date   | new_paid_thru_date | renewal_title                            | renewal_instructions                       |
      | 2018-12-30 | 2019-12-31         | t("users.renewal.title_time_to_renew")   | t("users.renewal.instructions")            |
      | 2018-12-31 | 2019-12-31         | t("users.renewal.title_time_to_renew")   | t("users.renewal.instructions")            |
      | 2019-01-01 | 2019-12-31         | t("users.renewal.title_renewal_overdue") | t("users.renewal.renewal_overdue_warning") |
      | 2019-01-05 | 2020-01-04         | t("users.renewal.title_renewal_overdue") | t("users.renewal.renewal_overdue_warning") |


  Scenario: Membership in grace period; all renewal requirements met and member pays
    Given the date is set to "2019-01-05"
    And I am logged in as "member-in-grace-period-all-reqs-met@example.com"
    And I am on the "user account" page
    Then I should see t("users.renewal.title_renewal_overdue")
    And I should see t("users.renewal.renewal_overdue_warning")
    And the link button t("users.show.pay_membership") should not be disabled
    When I click on t("users.show.pay_membership")
    And I complete the membership payment
    And the user is paid through "2020-01-04"


  Scenario: Must agree to Ethical Guidelines again: last agreed to them 1 day before start of current membership term
    Given the date is set to "2019-01-05"
    And I am logged in as "member-agreed-before-current-start@example.com"
    And I am on the "user account" page
    Then I should see t("users.renewal.title_renewal_overdue")
    And I should see t("users.renewal.renewal_overdue_warning")
    And I should see t("users.ethical_guidelines_link_or_checklist.agree_to_guidelines")
    And the link button t("users.show.pay_membership") should be disabled
